About the program -
The data set we are working with consists of data on primary and secondary weather metrics from different locations and different times of the year. 
No other weather applications allow the user to compare weather data between locations during a certain period. 
Our research has not changed the information problem since it’s conception because the problem is original and there are no other competitors.

What worked and what we learned-
We were able to easily integrate our current ERD into our application.
Using the tools we learned in the course, we were able to finely tune our styling to produce a better UI.
We didn’t use any new libraries from outside of class as we were well equipped with our scope of work. 
We found it interesting and challenging using Bulma and flex-box side by side

What didn’t work and we still learned from-
One obstacle we faced was connecting to the database from the backend with js.
We were unable to configure the programming to crud the date/time variable.
Finally, with the front end, we had trouble trying to get certain items to align where we wanted exactly. 

Moving Forward...-
If we were actually seeing success and were able to manage sprints with updates to the application, we would:
Update the user interface to allow for greater choice and user input
Allow for people to use the application worldwide, requires collecting data on major cities around the world
Allow for saved results
Allow people to open metadata for more depth on results

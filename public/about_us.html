            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Weather is an ever changing aspect of the world and wanting to compare different regions is difficult to do with current websites like weather.com. 
              With current weather sites only allowing a user to view and compare temperatures only for two regions it would be difficult to actually get into detail on 
              things like wind speeds, pressure, and precipitation. This site uses an interface that allows users to compare details from wind speed, precipitation, 
              pressure, and temperature, enabling detailed information about key weather conditions during a certain period. Ultimately, we want to provide users with
              insights on climate & weather so that they are able to make more informed travel decisions.
